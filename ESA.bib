  abstract = {We present a parametric physics-informed neural network for the simulation of personalised leftventricular biomechanics. The neural network is constrained to the biophysical problem in two ways: (i) the network output is restricted to a subspace built from radial basis functions capturing characteristic deformations of left ventricles and (ii) the cost function used for training is the energy potential functional specifically tailored for hyperelastic, anisotropic, nearly-incompressible active materials. The radial bases are generated from the results of a nonlinear Finite Element model coupled with an anatomical shape model derived from high-resolution cardiac images. We show that, by coupling the neural network with a simplified circulation model, we can efficiently generate computationally inexpensive estimations of cardiac mechanics. Our model is 30 times faster than the reference Finite Element model used, including training time, while yielding satisfactory average errors in the predictions of ejection fraction (-3\%), peak systolic pressure (7\%), stroke work (4\%) and myocardial strains (14\%). This physics-informed neural network is well suited to efficiently augment cardiac images with functional data and to generate large sets of synthetic cases for training deep network classifiers while it provides efficient personalization to the specific patient of interest with a high level of detail.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained popularity across different engineering fields due to their effectiveness in solving realistic problems with noisy data and often partially missing physics. In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

  abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are neural networks (NNs) that encode model equations, like Partial Differential Equations (PDE), as a component of the neural network itself. PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in creating a parametric representation of liquid sloshing inside a container stems from its practical applications in modern engineering systems. The resonant excitation, on the other hand, can cause unstable and nonlinear water waves, resulting in chaotic motions and non-Gaussian signals. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based framework for nonlinear liquid sloshing representation learning. The proposed method is a parametric modeling technique that is based on sequential learning and sparse regularization. The dynamics are categorized into two parts: linear evolution and nonlinear forcing. The former advances the dynamical system in time on an embedded manifold, while the latter causes divergent behaviors in temporal evolution, such as bursting and switching. The proposed framework’s merit is demonstrated using an experimental dataset of liquid sloshing in a tank under horizontal excitation with a wide frequency range and various vertical slat screen settings.},

  abstract = {In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in one-dimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem, we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient ∇ρ(x,t), the pressure p(x∗,t) at a specified point x=x∗ as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x∗ plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x∗ from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x∗ from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time. We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter γ in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter γ accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.},

Although considerable advances have occurred in the development of numerical and experimental techniques for studying liquid sloshing, discrepancies exist between these techniques, particularly in predicting time history of impact pressure. The aim of this paper is to study the sloshing phenomenon experimentally and numerically using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method. The algorithm is enhanced for accurately calculating impact load in sloshing flow. Experiments were conducted on a 1 : 30 scaled two-dimensional tank, undergoing translational motion along its longitudinal axis. Two different sloshing flows corresponding to the ratio of exciting frequency to natural frequency were studied. The numerical and experimental results are compared for both global and local parameters and show very good agreement.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},
